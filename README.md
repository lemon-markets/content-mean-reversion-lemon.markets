## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Heroku
If you are interested in hosting this project in the cloud, 
we suggest that you use Heroku to do so. To make the hosting 
work, you need to create a new project and connect

Additionally, you need to specify the environment variables
through Heroku directly. You can do so by either using:

```
heroku config:set [KEY_NAME=value ‚Ä¶]
```
or by adding them in your project in the Heroku Dashboard under
